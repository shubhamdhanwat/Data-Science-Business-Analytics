-Task1: Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

Problem statement In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

To predict: What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

Supervised ML : Supervised Machine Learning is a method where the models are trained using labeled data, it needs supervision to train the model.

-Task-2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML.

Problem Statement : Using given 'Iris' dataset predict the optimum number of clusters & represent it visually.

Determining the optimal number of clusters in a data set is a fundamental issue in partitioning clustering, such as k-means clustering, which requires the user to specify the number of clusters k to be generated.
K-means algorithm :
  The algorithm tries to find groups by minimizing the distance between the observations, called local optimal solutions.
  The distances are measured based on the coordinates of the observations. For instance, in a two-dimensional space, the coordinates are simple.
  
  The algorithm works as follow:
    Step 1: Choose groups in the feature plan randomly.
    Step 2: Minimize the distance between the cluster center and the different observations (centroid). It results in groups with observations.
    Step 3: Shift the initial centroid to the mean of the coordinates within a group.
    Step 4: Minimize the distance according to the new centroids. New boundaries are created. Thus, observations will move from one group to another.
    Repeat until no observation changes groups.     
    
 -Task-3 : Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail

Exploratory Data Analysis :
  - EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables       and the relationships between them.
 
 RESULT AND CONCLUSION
         - Profit is more than that of sale but there are some areas where profit could be increased.

        - Profit and Discount is high in First Class

        - Sales is high for Same day ship

        - Sub-category: Copier: High Profit & sales

        - Sub-category: Binders , Machines and then tables have high Discount.

        - Category: Maximun sales and Profit obtain in Technology.

        - Category: Minimun profit obtain in Furniture

        - State: Vermont: Highest Profit

        - State: Ohio: Lowest Profit

        - Segment: Home-office: High Profit & sales

        - Here is top 3 city where deals are Highest.

                    New York City

                    Los Angeles

                    Philadelphia

        - Sales and Profit are Moderately Correlated.

        - Quantity and Profit are less Moderately Correlated.

        - Discount and Profit are Negatively Correlated

        - Here is top 3 state where deals are Highest.

                    Califonia

                    New York

                    Texas

        - Wyoming : Lowest Number of deal,Highest amount of sales= Wyoming(11.8%)

        - Lowest amount of sales= South Dakota(0.8%)
